# Performance Testing Documentation

This document outlines the performance testing strategy and implementation for the identity-service to ensure it meets the high-load requirements specified in the project.

## Overview

The identity-service must handle high-load scenarios with the following performance requirements:

1. **Response Times:**
   - Authentication endpoints: ≤ 500ms average
   - Token exchange endpoints: ≤ 500ms average
   - Refresh token endpoints: ≤ 500ms average
   - Introspection endpoints: ≤ 500ms average
   - Revocation endpoints: ≤ 500ms average

2. **Throughput:**
   - Minimum 1000 requests/second for authentication endpoints
   - Minimum 2000 requests/second for token exchange endpoints
   - Minimum 3000 requests/second for introspection endpoints

3. **Concurrency:**
   - Support 10,000+ concurrent users
   - Maintain < 1% error rate under load
   - Scale horizontally with additional instances

## Performance Testing Strategy

### 1. Load Testing

Load testing verifies the system's behavior under expected and peak load conditions:

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Concurrent user authentication
  - Token exchange under load
  - Refresh token operations
  - Token introspection requests
  - Token revocation requests
  - Mixed workload scenarios

- **Test Metrics:**
  - Response time percentiles (50th, 95th, 99th)
  - Throughput (requests/second)
  - Error rates
  - Resource utilization (CPU, memory, database connections)

### 2. Stress Testing

Stress testing identifies the system's breaking point and behavior under extreme conditions:

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Gradually increasing load until failure
  - Sudden traffic spikes
  - Resource exhaustion scenarios
  - Database connection pool saturation

- **Test Metrics:**
  - Maximum sustainable throughput
  - Failure points and error patterns
  - Recovery time after stress
  - Graceful degradation behavior

### 3. Soak Testing

Soak testing validates system stability over extended periods:

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Continuous load for 24+ hours
  - Periodic traffic spikes
  - Database growth monitoring
  - Memory leak detection

- **Test Metrics:**
  - Response time consistency over time
  - Resource consumption trends
  - Database performance degradation
  - System stability indicators

### 4. Spike Testing

Spike testing validates the system's ability to handle sudden traffic increases:

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Traffic spikes 10x normal load
  - Rapid scaling events
  - Burst traffic patterns

- **Test Metrics:**
  - Response time during spike
  - Error rate during spike
  - Scaling response time
  - Recovery to normal performance

## Performance Test Implementation

### Test Scripts

The performance tests are implemented using Node.js with the following structure:

1. **simple-load-test.perf-spec.ts** - Basic load testing script
2. **advanced-load-test.perf-spec.ts** - Advanced load testing with detailed metrics
3. **stress-test.perf-spec.ts** - Stress testing to find breaking points
4. **soak-test.perf-spec.ts** - Long-running soak tests
5. **spike-test.perf-spec.ts** - Traffic spike simulation tests

### Test Configuration

Performance tests can be configured using environment variables:

```bash
# Service endpoint
SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:3001

# Test parameters
CONCURRENT_USERS=100
REQUESTS_PER_USER=10
TEST_DURATION=60

# Authentication parameters
CLIENT_ID=test-client
CLIENT_SECRET=test-secret

# Timing thresholds (milliseconds)
AUTH_THRESHOLD=500
TOKEN_THRESHOLD=500
REFRESH_THRESHOLD=500
INTROSPECT_THRESHOLD=500
REVOKE_THRESHOLD=500

# Database thresholds (milliseconds)
DB_QUERY_THRESHOLD=100

# Output file
OUTPUT_FILE=performance-results.json
```

### Test Execution

```bash
# Run simple load test
npm run test:perf:simple

  - Functional indexes for computed values

- **Query Optimization:**
  - Prepared statements for repeated queries
  - Connection pooling with optimal sizing
  - Batch operations for bulk inserts/updates

- **Caching Strategy:**
  - Redis for frequently accessed data
  - Query result caching for static data
  - Distributed caching for multi-instance deployments

### 2. Application Optimization

  - Streaming for large data transfers
  - Garbage collection optimization

- **Concurrency Control:**
  - Worker threads for CPU-intensive operations
  - Rate limiting to prevent overload
  - Circuit breakers for external dependencies

### 3. Infrastructure Optimization

- **Horizontal Scaling:**
  - Load balancing with sticky sessions for DPoP-bound tokens
  - Auto-scaling based on CPU/memory metrics
  - Geographic distribution for low-latency access

- **Vertical Scaling:**
  - Container resource limits and requests
  - Database connection pooling
  - Memory/CPU allocation tuning
